# GameEngineDesign_A3

Assignment 3 for the Game Engine Design Course.

Game Description: I have created a Unity program that has a level editor which allows the user to create a simple level where the game objects can be customized with the use of pattern design and the location/colors of each spawned object can be saved within a logfile.
